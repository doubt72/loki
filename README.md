# Loki

Loki is a low-key, quick and dirty utility to build static web pages using a
simple templating format.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the following command (you'll need to the bundler gem
installed):

```
bundle install
```

To install the gem, run the following commands (optionally replacing `*` with
the current version):

```
gem build loki.gemspec
gem install loki-*.gem
```

You can then run the loki command anywhere like this:

```
loki <source-dir> <destination-dir>
```

If you don't want to install the gem, you can alternately run loki from the loki
repository directory like so:

```
bin/loki <source-dir> <destination-dir>
```

If you'd like to run the tests, run:

```
rspec
```

There's also a pretty primitive Makefile that does all this for you (as well as
`make clean` which will uninstall and remove the gem).

## Using Loki

Loki requires a source and destination directory, and both of these paths must
exist before running loki.  In addition, the source directory must contain the
`views`, `assets`, and `components` directories before loki will run.

The `views` directory contains the pages generated by loki.  Any files in that
directory or any of its subdirectories will be interpreted as a page.

The `assets` directory contains any other objects (images, scripts, css, any
other random files) referred to in those pages.  Any assets will be copied to
the destination directory if (and only if) referenced by a page.

The `components` directory contains any components (templates, partials) needed
to build the pages.

## Loki Pages

Loki pages have two sections: metadata and body.  The sections are separated by
two dashes (`--`) on a line by itself.  Bodies can contain any arbitrary HTML
and directives (see below) enclosed in curly braces (`{` and `}`).  For example,
a page might look like:

```
id "home"
title "my home page"
css ["css/default.css"]
--
{include("partials/header.prt")}

<h1>This is my home page</h1>

Today is {Time.now}.

{link("about", "About Me", {class: "my-link"}})}
{include("partials/footer.prt")}
```

This might end up looking something like:

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>my home page</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/default.css" type="text/css" />
</head>
<body>
<div class="header">my header</div>

<h1>This is my home page</h1>

Today is 2016-03-28 00:05:56 -0600.

<a href="/about.html" class="my-link">About Me</a>
<div class="footer">my footer</div>
</body>
</html>
```

## Metadata Parameters

The following parameters are available:

* `id`: page id; must be unique. This is used to reference other pages with the
  link directive (see below).

* `title`: page title (will go in the head).

* `template`: template used for this page (if set). The template with the given
  name/path must exist in the `components` directory.

* `tags`: a list of tags

* `css`: a list of css files/paths; the files must exist in the `assets`
  directory and will be copied when referenced.

* `javascript`: a list of javascript files; the files/paths must exist in the
  `assets` directory and will be copied when referenced.

* `set`: custom metadata fields; requires two arguments: a key and a value. For
  example, if `set :foo, "bar"` is used in a page's metadata, `{page.foo}` in
  the body would insert `bar` into the page at that point.

* `global`: custom metadata fields; requires two arguments: a key and a value.
  For example, if `global :foo, "bar"` is used in a page's metadata,
  `{site.foo}` in the body would insert `bar` into the page at that point.
  Unlike with `set`, this value can be accessed in the body of any page on the
  site, not just the current page.

* `manual_data`: data for generating online manuals; see the manuals section
  below.

Values must be inside strings (they are interpreted as ruby strings; values can
also be returned from a `do`-`end` block).  You can also put arbitrary ruby code
in the metadata.  The `site` and `page` objects can also be used to return
values that are already set via `set` or `global` (or via the config hooks
below).

## Loki Directives

Any blocks of ruby code can be inserted inside of curly brackets (`{}`) in page
bodies.  This can be used to insert files or calculate values, etc.  The
following directives are available in the interpretation scope:

* `body`: only legal in templates, will include the page body (this is required
  somewhere in the template for it to meaningfully function as a template)

* `page`: the current page object; this can be used to access values set in
  metadata.  For example `{page.id}` would insert the value of the current
  page's `id` into the body.

* `page.set(<key>, <value>)`: sets a value for the page (same as set for
  metadata). For example, if `{page.set :foo, "bar"}` is inserted somewhere in
  the page, `{page.foo}` later in the body would insert `bar` into the page at
  that point.

* `site`: same as above, only for global site values.

* `site.set(<key>, <value>)`: sets a value for the site. For example, if
  `{site.set :foo, "bar"}` is inserted somewhere in the page, `{site.foo}` later
  in the body (or in the body of any page evaluated later) would insert `bar`
  into the page at that point.  This is a lot less useful that setting a
  `global` value in the metadata, since this wouldn't be evaluated until the
  page is being built and would only be accessible from other pages being built
  after it; values set in metadata happen when the pages are loaded before any
  of the pages are built and any evaluation happens, so are available to all
  pages no matter the order of processing.  Also see config hooks below.

* `include(<partial>)`: includes another file from the components directory

* `link(<id/path>, <text>)`: inserts a link to another page or asset; pages are
  referred by id, assets by path (don't include the 'asset' directory in the
  path, that will be prepended automatically).  Text will be the text of the
  link (or HTML or whatever).  Assets must exist in the source assets directory
  and will be copied to the destination directory.

* `link_abs(<url>, <text>)`: inserts an arbitrary absolute link.  Text is same
  as above.

* `image(<path>)`: inserts an image.  Image must exist in source assets
  directory and will be copied to the destination directory.

* `manual_ref(<section>, <text>)`: relative link to another section of a manual.
  This will render `<text>` with a link to the correct section of the manual; if
  `<text>` is omitted, the section name will be used.  See the manuals section
  below for more information.

* `render_manual`: generates manual HTML from manual data as defined in the
  metadata; see the manuals section below.

`link`, `link_abs`, and `image` can be passed an options hash as the last
argument; an `:id` key is used for ids, `:class` for classes, and `:style` for
styles.  Passing the option `:self_class` to links will instruct them to use the
supplied class if the link points to itself. Passing the option `:append` will
append the value to the link, i.e., something like `#top` could be appended to
the end of the url to link to the id `top` inside a page.  Passing the option
`:alt` to an image will specify an alt-text for that image.  Using a double open
curly brace (`{{`) will result in a literal curly brace (`{`) in the destination
file. Using a double close curly brace (`}}`) inside an evaluation context will
be a literal curly brace (`}`) instead of closing the context. You can put
arbitrary ruby code into the evaluation blocks, e.g., `{Time.now.year}` would
insert the year at that point in the page.

## Config Hooks

There are two special files in the top level of the source directory that (if
they exist) will be loaded at two different points in the run.  The first is
`config.rb` which is run before loading any of the pages.  The second is
`config_load.rb` which is run after all the pages are loaded but before they're
built/evaluated.

The contents of these files can be any arbitrary ruby, but the most important
use for these files is to set global site values.  This is done with the `set`
function.  For example, if the `config.rb` contains the line `set :foo, "bar"`,
when `{site.foo}` is included in any of the pages on the site, it will insert
`bar` at that point.

## Automatically Generating Manuals

Loki has built-in directives for generating dynamic manuals. The way this works
is that the data (text/html) used to build the manual is defined in the page
metadata with the `manual_data` directive, and the `render_manual` directive is
used in the body to render it.

The data for the manual must be list defined as such:

```
[<manual-name>, <introduction-text>, <section>, <section>...]
```

Where each section in the list of sections follows the same format:

```
[<section-name>, <text>, <optional-subsections>, <optional-subsection>...]
```

Where the optional subsections can be omitted if none exist.

For instance, a very simple manual might look like this:

```
["My Manual",
  "This is some introductory text",
  ["First Section",
    "This is the first section text"],
  ["Second Section",
    "This is the second section text",
    ["Subsection", "This is text for a subsection"],
    ["Another Subsection", "This is text for another subsection"]
  ],
  ["Third Section",
    "This is the third section text"]
]
```

Each of the sections will be automatically numbered and inserted in turn with
the `render_manual` directive, with a table of contents inserted after the
introduction text.  The sections can be regular HTML and will be inserted
after sections headers.  Each of the sections will be parsed, so any Loki
directives can be used; in particular, the `manual_ref` directive can be used to
make relative links to other sections.  References to other sections are made by
name, and must include the entire hierarchy separated by pipes (`|`), i.e., the
first subsection above would be referred to as so:

```
manual_ref('Second Section|Subsection')
```

If the section doesn't exist, it will raise an error.  Note that section `1`
will always be referred to as `Introduction` in the table of contents and should
be referred to the same way by `manual_ref`; the first header will be the manual
name as supplied to `manual_data`, however.

## To Do

* manual-making stuff
* favicon configuration
* arbitrary head data
